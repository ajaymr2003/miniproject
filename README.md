Abstract
The rapid global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) underscores the urgent need for a robust and intelligent charging infrastructure. Traditional EV charging systems often suffer from inefficiencies, including a lack of real-time information, prolonged waiting times, and driver range anxiety, hindering widespread EV adoption. To address these critical gaps, this project proposes the design and development of a Smart EV Charging Station Monitoring and Navigation System.
Leveraging the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the system aims to provide real-time monitoring of charging station availability and operational status, alongside efficient and intelligent navigation capabilities. The core objective is to assist EV users by offering live updates, optimized routing to available charging points, and the potential for booking slots. Simultaneously, the system empowers station operators with streamlined monitoring, usage analytics, and proactive maintenance alerts, ensuring optimal service delivery and improved energy management.
This technology-driven approach seeks to enhance user convenience and reliability while optimizing the utilization of charging infrastructure, laying a foundation for more scalable and intelligent EV networks that support sustainable urban mobility and grid stability.
